# Analyzing and predicting the  AQI(Air Quality Index) for Indian Cities

This project analyzes and predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Indian cities using historical data. It includes data exploration, feature selection, and model training to forecast AQI based on pollutants like PM2.5, NOx, SO2, and CO. Various machine learning models, including Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were tested, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy (0.92 cross-validation score). The final predictions are visualized on an interactive map, highlighting AQI trends over time. This study provides insights into air pollution patterns and helps in making data-driven policy recommendations for improving air quality in India.
Technology used: Python, MySQL, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, PyQt, Pickle
